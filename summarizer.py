"""
summarizer.py

Generates a short, natural-language explanation of a claim's verdict
using a local, free LLM served by Ollama (https://ollama.com).

No API key, no paid service, nothing sent to a third party: Ollama
runs entirely on your own machine. If Ollama isn't installed or isn't
running, `generate_summary` falls back to a plain templated sentence
built from the evidence counts, so the app still works without it --
just with a less natural-sounding summary.

Setup (optional but recommended):
    1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
    2. Pull a small model once:   ollama pull llama3.2
    3. Leave Ollama running in the background (it starts a local
       server at http://localhost:11434 automatically).
